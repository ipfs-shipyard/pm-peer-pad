### Planning next steps

### Other notes

UI:
- Make it simple for users to verify that they have access to the right publish or read key (like Signal and/or Telegram, show baseEmoji to encode the keys)
- Add timestamps to the snapshot
- Inspiration for UI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVmypx9HGI and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjZ7ktIlSM0&t=345s

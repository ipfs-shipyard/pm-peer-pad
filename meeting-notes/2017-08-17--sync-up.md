# Peerpad Sync up

Participants: David, Pedro

## Agenda:

Design: What is the UX we need for this pad, what is the information it should present? 
Features wish list:
Self contain the viewer (load snapshots from ipfs.io)
Encrypt snapshots (make it password protected within the viewer itself)
Support markdown
Support code view
Support codepen style
Upload files
Analytics (how to ask users to share them by privately)
Companion ? (CLI tracker / persister) - (Pedro) 
Can we ship something by MozFest (Oct 27~29)?
Tech Stack (React or? We need to know who to bring to the team)

## Notes:
